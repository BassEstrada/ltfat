-------- Compatibility ----------------------------------

The toolbox should work and compile on all versions of Octave later
than version 3.0, but it is generally recommended to upgrade to the
latest stable release of Octave. For demos etc. to work, you will need
to install the Octave-forge packages.

-------- Compiling the Octave interfaces  ------------------

LTFAT comes with C++ Octave interfaces written for all computationally
intensitive function in the toolbox.

To compile the Octave interfaces, type "ltfatmex" on the Octave command
prompt. This will compile all the available oct-functions.

For this to work, you will need to install the Octave development
packages (the 'mkoctfile' script must be available).

The oct-files links to certain libraries, most importantly to the
LTFAT C-library. In order to compile the oct-interfaces, you must
first have compiled the C library.

------- Octave on Linux ------ -----------------------------


To compile, install the Octave development package and all its
dependencies. This will also install all necessary libraries and
header files needed for compilation. 

* On Fedora / Redhat this package is called "octave-devel"

* On Debian / Ubuntu this package is called "octave-headers"

Install the octave-forge packages to add extra toolboxes available for
Octave.

--------- Compiling libltfat on Linux ------------------------------------

There is no binary release of libltfat for Linux, so you have to
compile it yourself. Fortunately, this is rather easy:

- Open a terminal, and change to the ltfat/src directory (using 'cd')

- Type 'make unixnomem'

------- Octave on Windows -------------------------------------

Octave on Windows is not yet supported.
