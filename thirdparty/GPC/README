The 'mulaclab' gui makes use of the GPC library from 

   http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/gpc/

If you wish to use 'mulaclab' you must download the software from the
homepage, extract it, and put it in this directory. Specifically,
there must be a 'gpc.c' and a 'gpc.h' file in this directory.

The library is free (as in beer) for non-commercial use. Please see
the GPC-README.pdf file in the downloaded package.

After download, execute the 'ltfatmex' command to compile the interface.
