Version 0.97 

	* Toolbox is now built upon a standalone C library.

	* 

Version 0.96 12/1 2009 svn no 728
	* Matlab MEX compilation now works under Windows. See the
	instructions in the INSTALL file.
	
	* Speed optimizations in the C-code used by DGT, DWILT and MDCT
	and their inverses.
	
	* New functions DGTREAL and IDGTREAL works with the positive
	frequencies of the DGT of real valued signals.

	* New functions FFTREAL computes only the positive frequencies of
	the FFT of a real valued input signal.
	
	* More systematic naming of functions:
		CANDUAL -> GABDUAL
		CANTIGHT -> GABTIGHT
		MIXDUAL -> GAMIXDUAL
		PROJDUAL -> GABPROJDUAL
		GFBOUNDS -> GABFRAMEBOUNDS and GABRIESZBOUNDS
		TF_ADAPTLASSO -> GABELITISTLASSO
		TF_GROUPLASSO -> GABGROUPLASSO
			
	* Reassignment is a method for sharpening the spectrogram. Support
	for reassignment is included in the new function REASSIGN and an
	easy to use plot RESGRAM.

	* Easy to use plot for plotting instantantaneous frequency:
	INSTFREQPLOT
	
	* Three different methos for computing instantaneous time and
	frequency: INSTTFDGT, INSTTFPHASE and INSTTFABS.

	* General speedup of many of the SPREAD* routines based on speedup
	in COL2DIAG and more efficient algorithms for sparse matrices.
	
	* COL2DIAG provides the basic coordinate change needed for
	efficient implementation of spreading function methods. COL2DIAG
	has a C-implementation.

	* New function WIL2RECT converts Wilson coefficients from the
	standard compact layout to a more loose layout, where the
	coefficients are appropriatly placed on the TF-plane. The
	rectangular format is welll suited for visualizing Wilson
	coefficients.

	* The functionality of GFBOUNDS was split into two methods
	computing either frame bounds or Riesz basis bounds

	* Dynamic range in SGRAM and RESGRAM is now specified by the
	'dynrange' parameter instead of previously 'range'.
	
	* greasylong and doppler signals added.

	* Periodic Heaviside function added, PHEAVISIDE.

	* Simple exponential wave added as EXPMODE.
	
Version 0.95 6/3 2008 svn no. 595

	* DCT based resampling function.
	
Version 0.94 24/10 2007 svn no. 556

	* Numerically stable computation of Hermite functions. Thanks to
	Thomasz Hrycak.

	* gabmulappr (approximation of an operator by a Gabor multiplier)
	now works with fast algorithm.

	* group lasso shrinkage and adaptive lasso shrinkage added with an
	example (examp_audioshrink)

	* Removed all support of lattices in the spreading operator
	routines, as this is not practically usefull.

	* Special support in candual for windows shorter than the number
	of channels.
	
	* The configure style system has been removed. Use ltfatmex instead.
	
	* phaseplot now uses the phaselocked dgt by default.

	
Version 0.93 10/8 2007 svn no. 504
	
	* Easy compilation of Mex/Octave interfaces by 'ltfatmex' command

	* Bug fixed for Wilson bases.

	* Better support of choosing an alternative dimension for the
	various transforms.

	* fmax option added to sgram

	* fftresample does Fourier interpolation 

	* phaseplot changed to always do full STFT 

	* moved to GPL v 3.0 license
